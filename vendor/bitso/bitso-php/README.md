# bitso-php #

A php wrapper for the [Bitso API](https://bitso.com/api_info/). 


# Installation #
To install the bitso-php api wrapper:
`$ composer require bitso/bitso-php:*`
or equivalently in your composer.json file:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "bitso/bitso-php": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

# Public API Usage #

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'

$bitso = new BitsoAPI\bitso();
```
The production API is set as default, to use Dev API:
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'

$bitso = new BitsoAPI\bitso('','',$url);
```

# Private API Usage #
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'

$bitso = new BitsoAPI\bitso(API_KEY, API_SECRET, URL);
```

See note above on how to use Dev API
# Note on Parameters #
Parameters must be arrays in the form of:
 ``` php
 ["arg1"=>"value","arg2"=>"value"]
 ```
 
Moreover, for methods such as lookup order, cancel order, there is no array of parameters, but there must be an array with order ids:

 ```php
 ['id','id','id]
 ```
 See specific calls for detailed examples.

## Testing ##
To test the library, after installing, write in your API Keys in either the bitso.php file or the two test files, then go to the root folder of the repository and run:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
Remember to input API Keys to test with, as the test files have empty slots for keys.
